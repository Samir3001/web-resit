					Previously, I talked about how I represent myself officially. But there's more about me which I find more interesting. Alongside being a computing sutdent, I also am a traveller who loves riding bikes. Being a software developer sure is really important for me for I am interested in programming and I always wanted to be addressed as an engineer as a child. This is my dream career and thankfully I've always got A's in the subject througout my entire school journey. But, that doesn't hold my definition. My definition is something else. I love riding bikes and travelling to different places I have never been before. I love to live with the locals and eat foods with them. Being a software developer sure is my dream job but, I will never stop travelling. I'm something that makes me happy and not something that helps get my bread. With that being said, my hobbies are eating, travelling, singing, dancing, surfing the net.

			The aims I have in life is to be a successful software developer and earn good amount for a living. And for that I'm determined about how ready I am to make the best of my college days. I also pursue a dream of selling myself out there in the world as an artis,but after I secure my life being a software developer. This fantasy is just a 'maybe' thing for me. But as I said I love riding bikes and travelling new places. Bottom line, I aim to be a succeful software developer.
